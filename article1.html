Every mom-to-be knows that, when it comes to preparing for the new addition to your family, one of the only fun things to look forward to throughout your pregnancy is the baby shower! Here are just a few of our best tips on how to leave your baby shower burned into your guests’ memories forever.

<h3> 1. Host it Off the Grid! </h3>
With so much potential for disappointment in public parks and backyards, simply relocating to a more secluded location can add so much more excitement and natural beauty. Simply locate a segment of the sprawling fields, forests, and deserts in any state, and all of a sudden your decoration work is done! The more secluded the location, the easier it will be to secure privacy for you and your guests, while also avoiding any of those pesky regulatory permits that come with hosting in a public park.

<h3> 2. Cooking On-Site!</h3>
No catering service could ever beat a freshly cooked meal, especially if your guests can participate in the cooking process. Lighting a bonfire to cook over or simply bringing your own barbecue adds an element of fun in itself without needing to worry about the extra expense of a catering company. Whether you’re roasting smores over the bonfire for an evening celebration or grilling kabobs for a lunchtime snack, there’s no doubt your guests will love sitting in the brush around a large bonfire.

<h3> 3. Sparkler Snapshots! </h3>
Every celebration has to have a perfect photo op and what better way to celebrate the mom-to-be than with sparklers! Out in the woods with no light pollution to worry about, the starry sky will make for a perfect backdrop to your sparking wands. Whether you’re using the color of the sparks for an electrifying gender reveal or writing messages with a long-exposure camera, there’s no doubt that sparklers will certainly spark your guests’ excitement.

<h3> 4. Fire Fireworks! </h3>
If sparklers aren’t quite a big enough bang, then look no further than a personalized firework display! Custom fireworks aren’t too hard to find through some light digging online, or through independent vendors in your area, and they’re guaranteed to make your party a memorable one! Of course, a secluded location is a must, as permits are nearly impossible to pull off, so going without is the only way to pull it off without a hitch! Nevertheless, fireworks make the perfect gender reveal or simply just to celebrate with some added excitement!

<h3> 5. Don’t Forget the Drinks! </h3>
While the mother-to-be won’t be able to drink, it’s always a good idea to provide some alcoholic beverages for the rest of the guests. A bonfire without drinks simply doesn’t compare, and there is plenty of potential for quirky themed cocktails or even a fun drinking game!
