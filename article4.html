    <h5>
      1. Ember
    </h5>
    The name Ember is a girl's name of French origin. Unlike Amber, which is in decline, this name still has a bit of a glow left -- though confusions between the two will inevitably arise.
    <br>
    <h5>
      2. Blaise
    </h5>
    As modern as it sounds, Blaise is an ancient Christian martyr name. In Arthurian legend, Blaise is the name of Merlin the Magician's secretary. Its relation to the word and name Blaze gives it a fiery feel.
    <br>
    <h5>
      3. Flint
    </h5>
    Flint is one of the new macho names on the rise today, part old-school tough guy, part rebel. You won't find a tougher, steelier-sounding name; it's part of a genre on the rise along with cousins Slate, Stone and Steel.
    <br>
    <h5>
      4. Ignacia
    </h5>
    The name Ignacia is a girl's name of Latin origin meaning "ardent, burning". This Spanish form of the yet-to-be-revived Ignatius was borne by an early and influential Philipina nun known as Mother Ignacia.
    <br>
    <h5>
      5. Cole
    </h5>
    The name Cole is a boy's name of English origin meaning "swarthy, coal black". A short name that embodies a lot of richness and depth -- has long been associated with the great songwriter Cole Porter.
    <br>
    <h5>
      6. Phoenix
    </h5>
    Phoenix rolls a lot of cool trends into one: it's a place-name and a bird name, it ends in the oh-so-hip letter x, and as the mythic bird that rose from the ashes, it's a symbol of immortality.
    <br>
    <h5>
      7. Hestia
    </h5>
    The name Hestia is a girl's name of Greek origin meaning "hearth, fireside". Hestia is the name of the Greek goddess of the hearth, home and chastity, a possibility for the parent in search of a classic name with deep roots that's also unusual.
    <br>
    <h5>
      8. Dante
    </h5>
    The name Dante is a boy's name of Italian, Latin origin meaning "enduring". Though closely associated with the great medieval Florentine poet Dante Alighieri, it's not as much of a one-man name as you might think.
    <br>
    <h5>
      9. Aidan
    </h5>
    The name Aidan is a boy's name of Irish origin meaning "little and fiery". Aidan was originally a pet form of the Irish name Aodh (pronounced 'ee'), the name of the old Celtic god of the sun and fire.
    <br>
    <h5>
      10. Egan
    </h5>
    The name Egan is a boy's name of Irish origin meaning "little fire". Egan's likeness to the word eager gives this Irish surname a ready-to-please, effervescent energy, and it would make an appropriate substitute for the overused Aidan.
